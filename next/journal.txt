Interface thoughts:

Breakpoint 0
    At 0
    Columns 4
Breakpoint 1
    At 768
    Columns 16
Add breakpoint

Rapid on
    Position classes on

Advanced
    Decimal places
    
Widths given at breakpoint 0 are just w1o3 etc. compared to breakpoint1 w1o3-b1

Realised that there are functions dependent on the app and utility functions.
And that the beauty of a function is that the dependencies are delivered via the arguments array.

So, was thinking that instead of all this classes, prototyping malarkey that requires understanding of what "this" is 
at any point, I'd just pass an object with everything in it and forget "this"

IE 6 and 7 bug

asd
<div class="col">
  <div class="col w2o3">
    <div class="gut" style="background:#dee;">Content
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="col w1o3">
    <div class="gut" style="background:#ede;">Sidebar
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
asd

Even though the outer .col is floated and therefore contains all floats.
IE6 and 7 display asdasd next to each other before the layout, seemingly
like the outer .col is not clearing floats.
This is fixed by wrapping the second "asd" in a block level element. An inline element will not do

I want to add a class to add a marginbottom equal to the line-height, probably should go on .col

Writing up the problem with gutters and positioning the floats with IE6.
The problem is
<div class="layout-gutter">
    <div class="layout w2o3 p2o3">
        <div class="column gutter">
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="layout w1o3 p1o3">
        <div class="column gutter">
        </div>
    </div>
</div>

where
    layout gutter has a negative margin-left of 50px
    gutter is margin-left:50px
    p1o3,p2o3 are both margin-right:-100%;
    p1o3 is margin-left:0;
    p2o3 is margin-left:33.3333%
